rules

The captain and vice-captain you choose to lead your team are awarded 2x and 1.5x points of the original total they score. However, in case of the deductions, the points of your captain are deducted as 2x only. The same is applicable in case of vice-captain.

In case a substitute replaces any on-field player in any circumstance, then the substitute will not be awarded any points for his/her part on the field. However, in case a player is announced as a Concussion Substitute, then the player shall be awarded (2) points for making an appearance on the field along with the points awarded on the basis of his/her on-field performance.

In case any on-field player is transferred in the middle of the series or game or already scheduled update, then such change shall not be reflected in the MyTeam11 roster immediately. The change might be reflected from the next scheduled update. The player will be available for selection on MyTeam11 amid the change made between the game or already scheduled update, but the player will not be awarded any points in MyTeam11.

The players are awarded starting points on the basis of the announcements made regarding their inclusion in the playing team for the game. In a scenario wherein a player, after being included in the team sheet for the match is unable to start the match, the player will not be awarded any points. However, the points shall be awarded to any player who acts as a replacement of such players who were included in the team sheet, but were unable to start the match and participate in the game.

If a match is being completed through the D/L method and a team plays for 50 overs in the first innings, it is mandatory for the other team to play at least 20 overs in ODIs and 5 Overs in T20s for the second innings.

No points will be awarded to the users during the Super Over of the game


Fantasy terms and conditions
   A user is allowed to choose 7 players in LIVE FANTASY and 2nd Innings. Out of these seven players, a maximum of 6 players can be selected from one team. There is no restriction on mandatory selection of all-rounders, batters, bowlers or wicket keepers. A user will be allocated a total of 65 credit points to create a team.

   Users will be asked to choose four players from their team who will fetch 4x,3x,2x and 1.5x points, respectively. Rest of the three players will fetch 1x points. Unlike normal fantasy where a user gets to choose Captain and Vice-Captain for 2x and 1.5x points respectively, it is little different in LIVE fantasy.

   Please note that users have to create separate teams for each LIVE fantasy slot and 2nd Innings.

   The stats (runs, wicket, strike rate, economy rate etc.) of the players will vary for each category. For example, a batsman who is batting from 1st over and plays till the 10th over and if a user plays LIVE fantasy in 5.1 to 9.6 over, the stats will be considered only for the chosen slot, which is 5.1-9.6 over.

   MyTeam11 will declare the match complete in two conditions: Either 40% of the balls in the selected slot of LIVE fantasy must be bowled or the live match must be declared complete, even if 40% balls are not bowled.
   For instance, if the live match is completed or declared complete (by Officials) before 40% of the balls in your selected slot/innings are bowled, MyTeam11 will declare the slot /innings complete. Also, the result of the selected slot/innings will be declared on MyTeam11 application on the ongoing LIVE match if 40% of the balls are bowled or the live match is declared complete before 40% balls are bowled.

   MyTeam11, at its discretion, can adjust the deadline of the selected slot/innings on the app by up to 6 balls before the beginning of the LIVE match.

   A user can check the scorecard and ranking of LIVE FANTASY in the respective category tabs.

   If a user chooses to make the fantasy team in the second innings, fantasy points will be offered only for the playersâ€™ performance in the 2nd innings.

   Stats, leagues, contests for every category will be different and not be clubbed at any circumstance.

   Fantasy points of first and second innings cannot be clubbed together.

   Entry fees and league size for live fantasy will vary respectively.

   The points system for each category remains unchanged.

   
Playing teams:

Gujarat Titans (GT) and Mumbai Indians (MI) have squared off each other in only four matches so far in Indian Premier League (IPL). Both Mumbai and Gujarat have secured wins in two matches each. Among these 4 GT vs MI IPL matches, two were hosted in Mumbai, while the remaining two took place in Ahmedabad. 

GT vs MI head to head record

GT vs MI matches played in IPL: 4

GT won: 2

MI won: 2

GT vs MI matches drawn: 0

Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium is considered favorable for both batters and pace bowlers. If there is pace and bounce for the fast bowlers here, the outfield will also be fast. It is likely that spinners won't get much help from the pitch here. If GT vs MI IPL 2024 match is hosted on a red clay pitch then the spinners might get some help. The decision to bat or bowl first may depend on the prevailing conditions. Over the last 20 matches, the average first innings score in Ahmedabad has been 174 runs.

According to the latest weather forecast for Ahmedabad, fans can expect an uninterrupted game on Sunday, with no rain predicted for the GT vs MI IPL 2024 match, scheduled to begin at 7:30 PM IST onwards.

Mumbai Indians Squad: Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan(w), Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, Hardik Pandya(c), Tim David, Shams Mulani, Piyush Chawla, Gerald Coetzee, Jasprit Bumrah, Luke Wood
